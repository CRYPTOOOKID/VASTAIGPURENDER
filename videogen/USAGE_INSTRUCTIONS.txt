üé¨ QUIZ VIDEO RENDERING SYSTEM - SETUP & USAGE
========================================

SETUP:
------
1. Install dependencies (first time only):
   cd videogen
   npm install

2. The system will use:
   - Quiz JSONs from: videogen/quiz jsons/
   - Audio files from: audiogen/output audios/[quiz_name]/
   - Output videos to: videogen/output/videos/

PREVIEW TEMPLATES:
------------------
To preview and edit templates:
   npm start

This opens Remotion Studio with 4 compositions:
   - Template1-GradientBlobs (original template)
   - Template2-Starfield (space theme - in development)
   - Template3-LiquidWaves (liquid waves - in development)
   - QuizVideo (main composition for rendering)

Switch between templates using the dropdown menu at the top.
All templates use "Famous Business Rivalries.1" quiz for preview.

USAGE:
------
Run the master render program:
   npm run render:master

OPTIONS:
--------
1. Render ONE randomly selected quiz
   - Picks an unrendered quiz at random
   - Selects a template automatically
   - Copies audio files to public folder
   - Renders the video

2. Process EVERYTHING available
   - Renders all unrendered quizzes
   - Progress is tracked automatically
   - Audio files copied automatically per quiz
   - Safe to stop and restart later

3. Show progress summary
   - View how many videos are completed
   - Check pending and failed renders

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
‚úÖ 3 Templates Available:
   - Template 1: Gradient Blobs (purple/pink gradients)
   - Template 2: Starfield (space theme with stars)
   - Template 3: Liquid Waves (flowing wave animations)

‚úÖ Template Selection:
   - Automatically selects a template for each quiz
   - Uses seeded randomness (same quiz = same template)
   - Ensures variety across all 430 videos

‚úÖ Progress Tracking:
   - Tracks completed, failed, and pending renders
   - Stored in: videogen/output/progress.json
   - Safe to interrupt and resume anytime

‚úÖ Audio Mapping:
   - Each quiz JSON has a matching audio folder
   - Example: "Famous Business Rivalries.1.json"
     Uses audio from: "audiogen/output audios/Famous Business Rivalries.1/"
   - Audio files are automatically copied to public/question_audios/ before rendering
   - This ensures browser can access files during render

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
‚ùå If render fails:
   - Check that audio folder exists for the quiz
   - Verify quiz JSON is valid
   - Check progress.json for error details

‚ùå If dependencies missing:
   - Run: npm install
   - Make sure Node.js and npm are installed

‚ùå To preview a template:
   - Run: npm start
   - Opens Remotion Studio for preview

NOTES:
------
‚ö†Ô∏è  Each video takes ~2-5 minutes to render
‚ö†Ô∏è  Full batch (430 videos) will take 15-35 hours
‚ö†Ô∏è  You can stop and resume anytime - progress is saved
‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed renders can be retried later
