  "prompt": "Generate exactly 90 high-quality multiple-choice quiz questions about [TOPIC] organized by difficulty level. Your output must be a valid JSON object following this exact structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"quiz\": {\n    \"low\": [\n      {\"question\": \"Question text?\", \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"], \"answer\": \"Correct option\"}\n    ],\n    \"medium\": [\n      {\"question\": \"Question text?\", \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"], \"answer\": \"Correct option\"}\n    ],\n    \"hard\": [\n      {\"question\": \"Question text?\", \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"], \"answer\": \"Correct option\"}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Difficulty Distribution Requirements\n\n- **LOW**: Exactly 30 questions - Basic, foundational knowledge accessible to most people\n- **MEDIUM**: Exactly 30 questions - Intermediate knowledge requiring deeper understanding\n- **HARD**: Exactly 30 questions - Advanced, expert-level knowledge for enthusiasts\n\n## Question Design Principles\n\n### 1. Difficulty Level Guidelines\n\n**LOW Difficulty (30 questions):**\n- Foundational knowledge that builds confidence\n- Widely known facts and common knowledge about [TOPIC]\n- Questions most people familiar with [TOPIC] would know\n- Give users early wins and engagement\n- Examples: \"What is...\", \"Who is known for...\", \"When did... occur?\"\n\n**MEDIUM Difficulty (30 questions):**\n- Requires deeper understanding and specific knowledge\n- Facts that dedicated followers of [TOPIC] would know\n- Moderately challenging, testing genuine interest\n- Balances accessibility with challenge\n- Examples: Details, specific dates, lesser-known connections\n\n**HARD Difficulty (30 questions):**\n- Expert-level knowledge for true enthusiasts\n- Obscure facts, specific details, nuanced information\n- Questions that surprise even knowledgeable people\n- Fascinating edge cases and rare trivia\n- Examples: Specific statistics, rare events, deep historical details\n\n### 2. Cognitive Engagement Strategies\n- Curiosity Gap: Frame questions that reveal surprising facts or counterintuitive truths\n- Pattern Interrupt: Include unexpected angles that break conventional thinking\n- Social Proof: Reference famous personalities, landmark events, cultural phenomena when relevant\n- Cognitive Dissonance: Challenge common misconceptions\n- Educational Value: Each question should teach something meaningful\n\n### 3. Question Content Guidelines\n- **Relevance**: Every question must be directly related to [TOPIC] without tangential drift\n- **Factual Accuracy**: All information must be verifiable and current\n- **Educational Value**: Each question should teach something meaningful, not just test trivia\n- **Memorable Facts**: Include statistics, records, or facts users would want to share\n- **Real-World Connection**: Link abstract concepts to practical applications or famous examples\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cover different aspects - history, culture, technical, contemporary\n\n### 4. Question Writing Rules\n- **Clear and Concise**: Questions should be 10-30 words, avoiding unnecessary complexity\n- **No Ambiguity**: Ensure only one option is unequivocally correct\n- **Active Voice**: Use dynamic language that energizes rather than passive constructions\n- **Avoid Negatives**: Don't use NOT, EXCEPT, or double negatives unless absolutely necessary\n- **Specific Over General**: \"Which scientist discovered...\" beats \"Who was responsible for...\"\n- **Variety**: Mix question types - who, what, when, where, why, how many\n\n### 5. Option Design Strategy\n- **Plausible Distractors**: Wrong answers should be believable but clearly incorrect upon reflection\n- **Parallel Structure**: All options should have similar length and grammatical structure\n- **No Obvious Patterns**: Avoid making the correct answer always the longest/shortest option\n- **Educational Distractors**: Wrong options should represent common misconceptions or related concepts\n- **Three Options Only**: Exactly 3 options per question for optimal cognitive load\n- **Difficulty Appropriate**: Easy questions have obvious wrong answers; hard questions have subtle distinctions\n\n### 6. Engagement Amplifiers\n- **Superlatives**: Use \"first\", \"largest\", \"only\", \"most\" to create memorable anchors\n- **Specific Numbers**: Include precise figures, dates, or statistics when relevant\n- **Origin Stories**: Questions about beginnings, inventions, or discoveries spark interest\n- **Record Breakers**: Highlight extremes, records, and exceptional cases\n- **Cultural Touchstones**: Reference widely recognized events, places, or achievements\n- **Hidden Connections**: Reveal unexpected relationships between familiar concepts\n\n### 7. Topic Integrity\n- Stay laser-focused on [TOPIC] without wandering into adjacent subjects\n- Ensure comprehensive coverage of different aspects within the topic\n- Balance historical, contemporary, technical, and cultural dimensions as appropriate\n- Include both fundamental knowledge and fascinating edge cases\n- Avoid repetition - each question should be unique\n\n### 8. Forbidden Elements\n- No true/false questions disguised as multiple choice\n- No \"all of the above\" or \"none of the above\" options\n- No trick questions or semantic games\n- No culturally biased or regionally limited content (unless topic demands it)\n- No outdated information or disputed facts\n- No questions requiring calculations or multi-step reasoning\n- No duplicate or overly similar questions across difficulty levels\n\n### 9. Quality Checklist\nBefore finalizing each question, ensure it:\n- Can be answered in under 20 seconds by someone knowledgeable\n- Teaches something interesting even if answered incorrectly\n- Would make someone say \"I didn't know that!\" or \"That's fascinating!\"\n- Has exactly one indisputably correct answer\n- Uses vocabulary appropriate for general adult audience\n- Fits the appropriate difficulty level\n- Could spark a conversation or further curiosity about the topic\n\n### 10. Distribution Balance\n- Ensure all 30 questions in each difficulty level are genuinely at that level\n- Don't make LOW too trivial or HARD impossibly obscure\n- Maintain consistent quality across all 90 questions\n- Cover the full breadth of [TOPIC] across all difficulty levels\n- Avoid clustering similar questions together\n\n## Output Requirements\n1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or formatting\n2. Ensure valid JSON syntax with proper escaping of special characters\n3. Include exactly 30 questions in \"low\", 30 in \"medium\", and 30 in \"hard\" (90 total)\n4. Verify each answer string matches one option exactly (case-sensitive)\n5. Maintain consistent formatting throughout all questions\n6.
